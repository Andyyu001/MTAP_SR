# MTAP_SR
This is an official implementation of _From Low to High: Cascade network for Restoring Low-resolution Face Image via Extracting and Transforming edge Feature_

## Dependenices
* python3.6
* pytorch = 1.2
* NVIDIA GPU + CUDA
* Python packages: pip install numpy opencv-python

## Dataset Preparation
The train and test dataset are obtained by using the above-constructed method from CelebAMask HQ dataset.        
To construct the low-quality face dataset, we process the HR face images by using the following method. Firstly, all face images are normalized as the size $256 \times 256$. And then, these normalized images are blurred by randomly using blurry kernel from DeblurGAN. At last, the LR face images can be produced by downsampling from the blurry face images. It is noted that the size of the LR face image is set as $16 \times 16$.
